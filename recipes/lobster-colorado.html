    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) filet mignon (beef tenderloin)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon OLD BAY® Seasoning</li>
        <li>8 ounces lobster tail, cleaned and chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set oven to Broil at 500 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle tenderloins all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap each filet with bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Place on a broiling pan, and broil to desired doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium rare.</li>
        <li>While tenderloins are cooking, melt 1/8 cup of butter over medium heat with 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay® seasoning. Stir in chopped lobster meat, and cook until done. Spoon lobster meat over cooked tenderloins, and return them to the broiler until the lobster meat begins to brown.</li>
        <li>While the lobster is in the oven, heat the remaining 1/8 cup of butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, cook until it browns, turning the color of a hazelnut. To serve, spoon the browned butter over the steaks, and sprinkle with the remaining Old Bay® seasoning.</li>
        <li><em>*Important*</em> Take Roast out of the oven 8°F–10°F before desired temperature and let sit for 10–15 minutes covered in aluminum foil. The roast will continue to cook for that time and reach your desired temperature (Rare 140° F / Medium 160° F / Well 170° F). Use meat thermometer for best results.</li>
